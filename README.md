This project makes it more enjoyable and efficient to use some common HTML events such as upload, click, double-click, etc
This project will be some of the common code used in the development of websites on the Internet (HTML, PHP, Javascript) and some commonly used events (click, double-click, drag, upload) and so on, so that you can more conveniently use the code I configured for you without writing it yourself, this project is still in the preliminary stage, the content is mostly from the Internet, the code explanation is less, please understand the developers, thank you!

I'm sorry you can't use the content in MyFirstHTML directly, because some of the components point to files in my project, and we will fix them as soon as possible
